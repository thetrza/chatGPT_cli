# chatGPT_cli
This is a simple program created with ChatGPT to integrate ChatGPT API into the cli of Kali Linux. 

The main features are using ChatGPT API as regular chat function, or pass a file as an argument and you can chat with the AI about the contents of the file.

Usage: python3 ./chatgpt_cli.py #This is for the regular chat function
        python3 ./chatgpt_cli.py /path/to/your/file #This is for passing a file to ChatGPT to chat about the file (It's always a good idea to refer to the OpenAI API documentation or reach out to their support for the most up-to-date information on file type and size limitations.)
        python3 ./chatgpt_cli.py -h #Help information
